# FaceDirectionRecognition
Determine FaceDirection with help of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This is one of the good Machine Learning approach where 
it's demonstrated how ANN has been trained with training examples. I used back-propagation algorithm. For Image , use few image processing
tools like Noise reduction (using Gaussain Filter), Edge detection (using Canny Algo) for better performance.
